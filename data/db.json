      "body": "<p>Over the past month, I worked on a not-so-serious side project called focusstopwatch.com (Itâ€™s open source. you can access the code here). The siteâ€™s purpose? To keep track of your focus time, enabling you to specify tasks and later evaluate your performance.</p><p> The concept came to me after feeling unsatisfied with existing focus/study systems. The traditional Pomodoro method, for example, didnâ€™t quite suit me. I needed a tool to accurately measure my productivity. Hence, FocusStopwatch concept became my go-to.</p>",

      "body": "<p>If you haven't heard of Svelte, it is a relatively new JavaScript framework that challenges the norm by shifting the bulk of the work from the browser to the compile/build step.</p><p>In doing that, it brings many benefits, most notably, the ability to ship less code to the browser (as you don't need the entire library like with frameworks such as React or Vue) as well as a bunch more stuff that I won't be talking about in this article as, in my opinion, the main benefit of Svelte is how easy it is to get started and how nice it is to use from a development perspective.</p>",

      "body": "<p>When it comes to building web applications, ensuring proper search engine optimization (SEO) and web shareability is crucial for increasing visibility and attracting users. In version 13, Next.js introduced the Metadata API, which allows you to define metadata for each page, ensuring accurate and relevant information is displayed when your pages are shared or indexed. In this blog post, we will explore how to leverage the Metadata API to enhance routing metadata.</p>\n\n<h2>Importance of routing metadata</h2\n\n <p> When users navigate to different pages within your Next.js application, it's important to provide, at the very least, appropriate document titles and descriptions. By default, the root layout of a Next.js application created using create-next-app includes a metadata object in the layout.tsx file. </p>",
