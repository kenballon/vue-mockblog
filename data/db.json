To keep track of your focus time, enabling you to specify tasks and later evaluate your performance.</p><p> The concept came to me after feeling unsatisfied with existing focus/study systems. The traditional Pomodoro method, for example, didn’t quite suit me. I needed a tool to accurately measure my productivity. Hence, FocusStopwatch concept became my go-to.</p>",
